;; There are a great many keybindings that are actively hostile,
;; in that they are bound to useless or obsolete functions that
;; are really easy to trigger accidentally.

;; These libraries are helpful to have around when writing little bits of elisp,
;; like the above. You canâ€™t possibly force me to remember the difference
;; between the mapcar, mapc, mapcan, mapconcat, the cl- versions of some of the
;; aforementioned, and seq-map. I refuse. shut-up is good for noisy packages.
