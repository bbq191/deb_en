;; Defer garbage collection further back in the startup process
(setq gc-cons-threshold most-positive-fixnum)

;; Emacs 29 no board
(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(undecorated . t))
;; (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(undecorated-round . t))

;; Faster to disable these here (before they've been initialized)
(push '(menu-bar-lines . 0) default-frame-alist)
(push '(tool-bar-lines . 0) default-frame-alist)
(push '(vertical-scroll-bars) default-frame-alist)

;; Prevent unwanted runtime compilation for gccemacs (native-comp) users;
;; packages are compiled ahead-of-time when they are installed and site files
;; are compiled when gccemacs is installed.
(setq native-comp-deferred-compilation nil ;; obsolete since 29.1
      native-comp-jit-compilation nil)

;; Package initialize occurs automatically, before `user-init-file' is
;; loaded, but after `early-init-file'. We handle package
;; initialization, so we must prevent Emacs from doing it early!
;; (setq package-enable-at-startup nil)

;; `use-package' is builtin since 29.
;; It must be set before loading `use-package'.
(setq use-package-enable-imenu-support t)

;; Resizing the Emacs frame can be a terribly expensive part of changing the
;; font. By inhibiting this, we easily halve startup times with fonts that are
;; larger than the system default.
(setq frame-inhibit-implied-resize t)
